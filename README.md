# Prework-Study-Guide Webpage
## code for the prework-study-guide course


- My motivation to start this prework study guide is so I can prepared for the coding bootcamp.
- I built this project to challenge myself into writing code using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- It creates an intereactive website for bootcamp student to see and test.
- In this project i learned how to utilize GitHub, create repositories in GitHub, how to use the command line (Git Bash in my case for Windows) and how to connect it to code editor (VS Code).
