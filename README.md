# Prework-Study-Guide Webpage
## code for the prework-study-guide course


- My motivation to start this prework study guide is so I can prepared for the coding bootcamp.
- I built this project to challenge myself into writing code using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- It creates an intereactive website for bootcamp student to see and test.
- In this project i learned how to utilize GitHub, create repositories in GitHub, how to use the command line (Git Bash in my case for Windows) and how to connect it to code editor (VS Code).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
